## Protocol info packet:

To get information from a heat pump, "magic" packet should be send to CN-CNT:

To get decimal values you must convert from hexadecimal and do some calulation depending on value. Most of them need just -128(DEC). \
As example 43 bit value to get DHW tank water set temperature b1 (HEX) = 177(DEC) - 128 = 49 C  \
Panasonic query, answer and commands are using 8-bit Checksum (CRC-8) to verify serial data. Last bit is checksum value.
