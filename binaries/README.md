This directory contains released and test versions for the HeishaMon software. 

The LittleFS versions will, after updating to this version, reset your HeishaMon to factory default due to change to a new filesystem for the configuration.

From version 1.0 some topics are changed so you need to update your automation for this.
The sensors are now in /main/ (before /sdc/) and the commands are expected in /commands/ (before in root topic). Check MQTT-Topics.md for the overview of all topics
